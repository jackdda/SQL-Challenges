# SQL-Challenges
This repository catalogues many of the online SQL challenges I've participated in with individual folders designating the challenge's origin. If applicable, these challenges are then sorted by the posted challenge difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Depending on challenge source requirements, these answers may be answered using T-SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
