# SQL-Challenges
This repository catalogues many of the online SQL challenges I've participated in with individual folders designating the challenge's origin. If applicable, these challenges are then sorted by the posted challenge difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Most of these questions are answered using either T-SQL or MySQL with the remaining few employing PostgreSQL.
